"""UDP fault-injection relay for testing Haven's mosh client (#421).

Sits between the phone and a local mosh-server and can drop traffic on demand,
which reproduces the one condition that is otherwise hard to manufacture: the
session goes silent while the device still has a perfectly good network. That is
what separates "roaming, keep waiting" (mosh's whole point) from "this session
is never coming back", and it is the case Haven used to sit in forever behind a
"retrying" banner.

Blackholing the relay is deliberately NOT the same as turning the phone's Wi-Fi
off: the phone stays online, so the client's connectivity check still says
"network is up" and the #421 escalation is allowed to fire. Turning Wi-Fi off
instead exercises the opposite path — the one that must never give up.

Usage:
    # 1. start a mosh-server and the relay in front of it
    ./mosh-fault-rig.py start

    # it prints the MOSH_KEY + relay port to use from the phone, then:
    ./mosh-fault-rig.py blackhole    # silence the session (device stays online)
    ./mosh-fault-rig.py pass         # resume forwarding
    ./mosh-fault-rig.py status
    ./mosh-fault-rig.py stop

Control is a tiny file the relay polls, so the toggles work from any shell
(or over SSH from a test script) without signals or a control socket.
